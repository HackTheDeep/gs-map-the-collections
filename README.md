GS@HackTheDeep: Map the Collections

## **Approach**

// Full Stack end-to-end user experience - from importing the file, cleaning and enriching the data then finally visualising it with full search capability



## **Tech Stack**

//- Flask python framework

//- Worms API for taxonomy look up

//- Google Maps API for visualistion and geolocation look up

//- Python autocorrect library for spell checks

//- ElasticSearch to store the new transformed data

//- React.Js for a modular UI



## **Challenges**

// Taxonomy look up: special characters are currently ignored this causes more errors in the data than there actually could be

// API calls needed to all be batched up

// Run time for full transformation is currently quite lengthy

// Learning ReactJS and other new libraries from scratch

// Date format when purely text i.e. "Summer of 1992"



## **Future**

// - create and extend the cleaning process to more columns

// - populate sparse location attributes by backtracking enriched geocoordinates

// - create a rest API to receive the "dirty" data file instead of manually uploading the file

// - add additional visualisation libraries on top of elasticSearch - now data stored in an easy query-able state
